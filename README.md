## DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
## INSTRUCTOR: EOIN O BRIEN

## TEAM MEMBERS:

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Document indexing, search, and keyword autocomplete

## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- The project will be implemented in C++.
- Use a trie for the autocomplete functionality.

## Project Infrastructure
- We have chosen CMake as our build system because it is fun and good.
- We have chosen GoogleTest as our testing framework as it has a gentle learning curve and includes features like parameterized testing.

## CI/CD
- We are using a commit naming convention that uses a code in square brackets to indicate what kind of change the commit is making.
    - **[FEAT]**: Feature Change
    - **[TEST]**: Adding test data
    - **[DOC]**: Documentation change
    - **[REFAC]**: Code refactor

## NOTES:
- I reckon we should seperate the file ingress and index creation from each other so its easier to test.


## AI Usage:
- Generated example documents with ChatGPT
